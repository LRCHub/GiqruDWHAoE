Disgusted by your weakness
You have no right to live
To know you... is to hate you
But your life's yours to give
You monkey-see; you monkey-do
You're always doing what they
tell you to
You're such a puppet on a string
You don't get it
I won't bow to something that
I've never seen
I can't believe in something
that doesn't believe in me
I'm not blood of your blood
I'm no son of your God
I've no faith in your fate
Still, I find salvation
You think you have the
answers...
To every last detail
In your eyes, you're the
"victor"?
In mine, you've all but failed
