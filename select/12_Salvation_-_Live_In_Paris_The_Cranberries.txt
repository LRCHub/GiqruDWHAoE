1-2-3 go!
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

To all those people doin' lines
Don't do it, don't do it
Inject your soul with liberty
It's free, it's free

To all the kids with heroin eyes
Don't do it, don't do it
Because it's not not what it seems
No, no it's not not what it seems

Salvation, salvation, salvation is free
Salvation, salvation, salvation is free

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

To all the parents with sleepless nights
Sleepless nights
Tie your kids home to their beds
Clean their heads

To all the kids with heroin eyes
Don't do it, don't do it
Because it's not not what it seems
No, no it's not not what it seems

Salvation, salvation, salvation is free
Salvation, salvation, salvation is free

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah (ah-ah-ah)

1-2-3!
Salvation (salvation) salvation is free
Salvation, salvation, salvation is free

Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah (ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
Ah-ah-ah (ah-ah-ah)
