Salvation code
The salvation code
The salvation code
I hold on to the notion
That I just wasn't born to die
Buried beneath the motion
Of life I never stop to question why
I've been dreaming of a savior
To pull me from this lowly place
She's analog and digital
Halo of light around her face
The path becoming clearer
I'm getting closer
And every day I'm nearer
To the salvation code
The salvation code
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer to
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer to
The salvation code
I'm still sticking to the notion
There's a bigger story left to tell
Sunk way down low in Tokyo
In the lowest level of this hell
Transmissions coming from my savior
Receiving in this lonely place
They're analog and digital
And they're guiding me through time and space
The path becoming clearer
I'm getting closer
And every day I'm nearer
To the salvation code
The salvation code
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer to
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer to
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer, nearer
The salvation code
The path becoming clearer
I'm getting closer
And every day I'm nearer
To the salvation code
The salvation code
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer to
The salvation code
It's all clearer now
And I hear her now
And I'm nearer to
The salvation code
Salvation code
